# California Climate Action Initiative
This project was started at UC Berkeley in January 2024 by Ana Santasheva working with Duncan Callaway. It is funded by a research grant from the Climate Action Initiative: https://uckeepresearching.org/california-climate-action/

This project currently includes a framework for electricity cost calculation for a residential user. It may later expand to other uses.
